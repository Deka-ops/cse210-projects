Explain the meaning of Encapsulation.
Encapsulation is just like putting some important documents inside a secure box or suitcase, 
allowing those with the pass key or code access to it. Here in c#, with encapsulation, you 
keep your codes privates but you control how others gain access to it.

Highlight a benefit of Encapsulation.
Encapsulation Protects ones date. It makes the code easier to be read and understood and easier to be maintained.

Provide an application of Encapsulation.
Aside the scripture memorization that uses encapsulation to hide words, we equally have the mobile app log in that 
hides and stored the password safely using only the loggin method to check the passcode.

Use a code example of Encapsulation from the program you wrote. (You should copy and paste a few lines of code that demonstrate the use of the principle.)

public class Word
{
    private string _text;
    private bool _isHidden;
}

it hides internal data as such other classes canâ€™t see or change _text or _isHidden directly.
