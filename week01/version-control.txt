What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, 
allowing developers to track, manage, and revert to previous versions 
of their code. It ensures that every modification made to a project is 
stored and can be retrieved or reviewed when necessary. Version control 
is essential for collaborative software development because it helps 
coordinate work among multiple people, ensures consistency, and prevents 
code conflicts or data loss.

Benefit of Version Control
One major benefit of version control is collaboration. 
Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously 
without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.

Example of Version Control in Use
In a software development team, version control is often used through Git. 
Suppose a team is building a web application. Each developer creates a branch 
to work on a specific feature, such as login functionality or user profile management. 
After making changes and testing locally, they commit their changes and push them to a 
remote repository like GitHub. A team lead or reviewer then initiates a pull request to 
merge the feature branch into the main branch, ensuring that the code is reviewed, tested, 
and approved before integration.

Show a command used in Version Control (for example a Git command)

git status:  shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.


Thoroughly explain these concepts:

In other words, Version control uses git as a system that records changes in files over time.
It helps coordinate works among a team of people working together on a particular project, as 
it ensures that there is no loss of data and prevents code conflict.
It is very good for collaboration because it gives each developer the opportunity to work on a 
specific feature.
